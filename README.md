# TicTacToe Game
Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game in which the objective is to take turns and mark the correct spaces in a 3x3 board. So, the board is of 9 squares and each player will play their chance one by one by placing either ‘X’ or ‘O’. The player who places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row wins the game. If all 9 squares are full and no players follow the winning criteria then the game will be drawn.

## Rules
The rules are described below :

- X always goes first.
- Players cannot play on a played position.
- Players alternate placing X’s and O’s on the board until either:
	- One player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally
	- All nine squares are filled.
- If a player is able to draw three X’s or three O’s in a row, that player wins.
- If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
